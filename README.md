# Federated-Learning

This repository contains code for Federated Learning based projects using the Flower Framework. Standard machine learning approaches require centralizing the training data on one machine or in a datacenter.Federated Learning enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all the training data on device, decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud. This goes beyond the use of local models that make predictions on mobile devices by bringing model training to the device as well.

## Projects

**1. CIFAR10 Classification:** Using the CIFAR10 Image Classification Dataset to start off with exploring the Flower Framework, using the documentation at [Quickstart(PyTorch)](https://flower.dev/docs/quickstart_pytorch.html)
